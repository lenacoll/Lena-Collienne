<p>Currently, Iâ€™m PhD candidate at the <a href="https://biods.org/">Biological Data Science lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/computer-science/index.html">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz">Univeristy of Otago</a>.
My main interests are in (mathematical and computational) phylogenetics as well as in discrete mathematics and graph theory.</p>
