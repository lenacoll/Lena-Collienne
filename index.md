Iâ€™m currently Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Biological Data Science lab](https://biods.org/) at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).  
In March 2023 I will start a position as Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Matsen Group](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) at the [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html).

My main interests are in (mathematical and computational) phylogenetics.
I am exploring the space of discrete coalescent trees by considering its graph theoretical and algorithmic properties.
