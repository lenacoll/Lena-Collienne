Iâ€™m currently PhD student at the [Biological Data Science lab](https://biods.org/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/computer-science/index.html) at [Univeristy of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz).

My main interests are in (mathematical and computational) phylogenetics.
Within my PhD I am exploring the space of discrete coalescent trees by considering its graph theoretical and algorithmic properties.

In 2021 I am president of the Otago Computer Science Society (OCSS) as well as member of the postgraduate committee of the Department of Computer Science at Otago.
