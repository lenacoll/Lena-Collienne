## Home
Iâ€™m currently PhD candidate at the [Biological Data Science lab](https://biods.org/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/computer-science/index.html) at [Univeristy of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz).
My main interests are in (mathematical and computational) phylogenetics.
