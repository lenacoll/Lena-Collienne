Iâ€™m currently Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Biological Data Science lab](https://biods.org/) at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).

My main interests are in (mathematical and computational) phylogenetics.
I am exploring the space of discrete coalescent trees by considering its graph theoretical and algorithmic properties.
