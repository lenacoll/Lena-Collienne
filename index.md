Iâ€™m currently PhD student at the [Biological Data Science lab](https://biods.org/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.otago.ac.nz/computer-science/index.html) at [Univeristy of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz).

My main interests are in (mathematical and computational) phylogenetics.
Within my PhD I aim to develop online algorithm for phylogenetic tree inference.
Furthermore, I am exploring the space of discrete time-trees by considering its graph theoretical and algorithmic properties.
